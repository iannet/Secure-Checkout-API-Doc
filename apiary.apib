# Figure Cart

Figure Cart is an API for creating customer facing applications powered by the Figure Commerce e-commerce platform.

## Headers

There are 3 HTTP Headers used by the cart API:

+ Content-Type
+ X-Auth-Token
+ X-Session-Id

The *Content-Type* header is a standard header and should be set to application/json for all requests.

The *X-Auth-Token* header is used to authenticate with the API server. To obtain an API key for your application you will need to contact Offset Partners LLC to request access.

The *X-Session-Id* header is used to identify the current client session for a request in order to maintain state across API calls. It should be a unique token for each client session and must be used when accessing cart state or when accessing user data that requires a user to logged-in to access.
